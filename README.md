<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

In this project I have developed a single page booking application with react and mobx libraries. App name is Booky. A user can sign up/login to see the details of sellers and book/view/delete an appointment.

App uses react router to route to different components. 

There is no backend in this project, its totally depending in localStorage.
